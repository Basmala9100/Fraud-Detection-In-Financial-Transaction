# üîçüí≤ Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

### üìú **Overview**  
The exponential growth of digital financial transactions has led to a parallel rise in fraudulent activities, making fraud detection a critical issue for the financial industry. As online payment systems evolve, fraudsters employ increasingly sophisticated methods, posing significant challenges to the security and integrity of financial operations.

Machine learning (ML) offers powerful solutions, improving fraud detection by analyzing vast transactional datasets in real-time, adapting to new patterns, and providing more accurate, proactive fraud prevention. By reducing false positives and enabling faster detection, ML-powered models significantly outperform traditional rule-based approaches.

### üöÄ **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Searching and Collection**  
   Gathering financial transaction data from various sources (e.g., Kaggle, other financial datasets) to form a solid foundation for model training.
   [Credit Card Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions) , [Phishing Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset/data)
2. **Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing or corrupted data.
   - Transforming categorical data into numerical representations.
   - Removing irrelevant features and scaling the data as needed.

3. **Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization**  
   - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and patterns.
   - Visualizing the data using various plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to gain insights into fraud indicators.

4. **Model Architecture Design**  
   Designing ML models suited to fraud detection, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, along with an ensemble of techniques.

5. **Applying NLP Techniques to Text Datasets**  
   Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process and analyze unstructured text data and enhance fraud detection. Techniques used include:
   - **SpaCy** for text parsing.
   - **NLTK** for tokenization and sentiment analysis.

6. **GAN Implementation for Data Generation**  
   Implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic synthetic data to train the fraud detection models, allowing the system to handle class imbalance in datasets.

7. **Model Deployment and Testing**  
   Deploying the trained model using **Streamlit** for real-time user interaction and predictions. Integrating fraud detection within a web-based interface for end-user testing.

8. **MLFlow for Model Version Control**  
   Implementing **MLFlow** to track model versions, performance metrics, and experiment outcomes, ensuring the system is easy to manage and reproduce.

9. **Testing in Real-world Applications**  
   Simulating real-world transactions and scenarios to evaluate model performance in detecting fraud, and fine-tuning based on results.
